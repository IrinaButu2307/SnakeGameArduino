# SnakeGameArduino
Components used :  
* Arduino UNO
* 8x8 LED Dot Matrix Display
* 16x2 LCD
* Joystick
* Connecting wires (mother-mother, father-mother)
* 2 X Bread Board
* Resistance 220 Ohm

How to play:  
    The game begins by pressing the joystick. The goal is to reach a score as high as possile. In order to do that, you have to eat(touch) the food (the dots that are lightened along your way). You can choose to go up, down, left or right, using the joystick. If you don't change the snake's direction, it will continue to move in the last direction you've chosen. Don't forget that with every bite taken, the snake's speen increases, making your moves sometimes tricky. The game ends when the snake bites its body.

Scoring & Difficulty:
* the score increseas by 10 when the snakes bites the food
* the difficulty increases at every bite; the delay between lightening and switching off the snake's body on the matrix
